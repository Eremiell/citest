Endangered animal species shelter game.

## Game

* You're an endangered species shelter manager.
* The game is turn based.
* Your shelter is separated into zones, where you can keep species. (Square grid)
* Each zone can be one of several biomes.
* Species appear randomly at one of your shelter gates. You get a notification of incoming species few turns ahead.
* Species can survive limited number of turns out of their habitat. (Only some species? Some species could be multi-habitat.)
* Some species can't be helt next to each other or even close to each other (radius). E.g. lions/zebras.
* Each turn you can move a limited number of species (one?) (x)or renovate limited number of habitats to something else (one?).
* Once you survive enough turns/host enough species, new rows or columns may unlock.
